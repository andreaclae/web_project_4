This project is a mockup social media page similar to an Instagram.

This is my first time utilizing JavaScript to make a webpage. This includes: functions, if statements, and queryselectors. I have also used, grids, flexboxes, positioning. I utilized a brief from Figma in order to get all of the different criteria for the page.

Hope you enjoy! :)
